# NPS Surveys with Segment, Zapier, and Customer.IO

Many interesting Net Promoter Score tools have been introduced over the last year or two. The challenge with all of them is that they re-create the wheel in terms of how they work alongside your other marketing efforts. For example, they send emails but they do not integrate with your other marketing email efforts.

This leads to great unpleasantness for example being asked to give an NPS rating when youâ€™ve unsubscribed from all emails, or at an awkward time in the customer lifecycle.

The flipside however, is to not use these tools, and simply ask the customer for NPS via your existing marketing tools with a Wufoo form but if you do this, you do not get all the nifty reporting that these tools offer:
